# Hyperfoil Website

The [Hyperfoil website][https://hyperfoil.io] is built using [Hugo][] with [Dcosy]() theme 

In this website, the `Docsy` theme is pulled in as a Hugo module, together with
its dependencies:

```console
$ hugo mod graph
...
```

> All documentation changes should be made in this directory, and the website will be automatically built and deployed during the release process.

## Running the website locally

Building and running the site locally requires a recent `extended` version of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).
You can find out more about how to install Hugo for your environment in our
[Getting started](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/getting-started/#prerequisites-and-installation) guide.

Once you've made your working copy of the site repo, from the repo root folder, run:

```bash
hugo server
```

## Running a container locally

You can run docsy-example inside a [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)
container, the container runs with a volume bound to the `docsy-example`
folder. This approach doesn't require you to install any dependencies other
than [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) on
Windows and Mac, and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
on Linux.

1. Build the docker image

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

1. Run the built image

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   > NOTE: You can run both commands at once with `docker-compose up --build`.

1. Verify that the service is working.

   Open your web browser and type `http://localhost:1313` in your navigation bar,
   This opens a local instance of the docsy-example homepage. You can now make
   changes to the docsy example and those changes will immediately show up in your
   browser after you save.

### Cleanup

To stop Docker Compose, on your terminal window, press **Ctrl + C**.

To remove the produced images run:

```bash
docker-compose rm
```
For more information see the [Docker Compose documentation][].

## Troubleshooting

As you run the website locally, you may run into the following error:

```console
$ hugo server
WARN 2023/06/27 16:59:06 Module "project" is not compatible with this Hugo version; run "hugo mod graph" for more information.
Start building sites …
hugo v0.101.0-466fa43c16709b4483689930a4f9ac8add5c9f66+extended windows/amd64 BuildDate=2022-06-16T07:09:16Z VendorInfo=gohugoio
Error: Error building site: "C:\Users\foo\path\to\docsy-example\content\en\_index.md:5:1": failed to extract shortcode: template for shortcode "blocks/cover" not found
Built in 27 ms
```

This error occurs if you are running an outdated version of Hugo. As of docsy theme version `v0.7.0`, hugo version `0.110.0` or higher is required.
See this [section](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/get-started/docsy-as-module/installation-prerequisites/#install-hugo) of the user guide for instructions on how to install Hugo.

Or you may be confronted with the following error:

```console
$ hugo server

INFO 2021/01/21 21:07:55 Using config file:
Building sites … INFO 2021/01/21 21:07:55 syncing static files to /

```

This error occurs if you have not installed the extended version of Hugo.
See this [section](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/get-started/docsy-as-module/installation-prerequisites/#install-hugo) of the user guide for instructions on how to install Hugo.

Or you may encounter the following error:

```console
$ hugo server

Error: failed to download modules: binary with name "go" not found
```

This error occurs if you have not installed the `go` programming language on your system.
See this [section](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/get-started/docsy-as-module/installation-prerequisites/#install-go-language) of the user guide for instructions on how to install `go`.
