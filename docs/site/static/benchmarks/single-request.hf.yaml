# This is the name of the benchmark. It's recommended to keep this in sync with
# name of this file, adding extension `.hf.yaml`.
name: single-request
# We must define at least one HTTP target, in this case it becomes a default
# for all HTTP requests.
http:
  host: http://hyperfoil.io
# Simulation consists of phases - potentially independent workloads.
# We'll discuss phases more in detail in next quickstarts.
phases:
# `example` is the name of the single phase in this benchmark.
- example:
    # `atOnce` with `users: 1` results in running the scenario below just once
    atOnce:
      users: 1
      scenario:
      # The only sequence in this scenario is called `test`.
      - test:
        # In the only step in this sequence we'll do a HTTP GET request
        # to `http://hyperfoil.io/`
        - httpRequest:
            GET: /
            # Inject helpers to make this request synchronous, i.e. keep
            # the sequence blocked until Hyperfoil processes the response.
            sync: true
