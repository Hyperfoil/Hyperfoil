Steps are the basic building blocks that form each sequence of a scenario, similar to statements in a programming language. Steps are potentially blocking (the sequence cannot continue with next step until previous one finishes).

Note that every [action](/docs/reference/actions/) can be also used as a step that simply never blocks, as actions do not require any extra input.
